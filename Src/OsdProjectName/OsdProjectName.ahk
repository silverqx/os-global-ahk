; This code was originally in the OsGlobal.ahk, but it caused problems, the OnWmPowerBroadcast() handler
; for the OnMessage(0x218, 'OnWmPowerBroadcast') was called twice! I think it was because
; the CreateCommonOSD() creates a window behind the scene, so I got two windows and so it was called twice.
; Because of that I have created this standalone script for project name OSD-es.

#Include Hotkeys\Hotkeys.ahk
